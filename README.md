# SmartSolarDewateringSystem 💧☀️  
### Team: Dewforce

## 🌍 Project Overview
**SmartSolarDewateringSystem** is an innovative, sustainable solution designed for **remote mining operations** where grid electricity is unavailable or unreliable.  
The system uses **high-efficiency solar panels**, **submersible pumps**, and **intelligent control algorithms** to remove groundwater from mines efficiently while minimizing energy waste.

By leveraging **renewable energy** and **adaptive smart controls**, our system ensures continuous, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly dewatering — improving both productivity and sustainability in mining operations.
